# ðŸ”’ ðŸ”‘ CRYPTOGRAPHY

 This repository is a collection of cryptography algorithms, covering various aspects of modern cryptography. It includes both symmetric key cryptography and public key cryptography, as well as other related topics such as interactive and non-interactive proofs, zero knowledge proofs, Shamir secret sharing schemes, and multi-party computation.
#### Resources
> In this repository, you will find implementations/articles of popular cryptography algorithms, along with documentation and examples to help you understand how they work. The repository is open to contributions, so feel free to add additional resources or improvements through pull requests.


> The current list of topics covered in this repository includes:

- Symmetric Key Cryptography: Basic concepts, properties, and examples of symmetric key algorithms such as Caesar cipher, Data Encryption Standard (DES), and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
* Public Key Cryptography: Introduction to asymmetric cryptography, including key pairs generation, encryption, and decryption using public and private keys. Examples of common public key algorithms like Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA), Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA), and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).
* Interactive and Non-Interactive Proofs: Understanding of interactive and non-interactive zero knowledge proofs, their properties, and use cases.
* Zero Knowledge Proofs: Introduction to zero knowledge proofs, their applications in authentication, privacy, and secure communication.
* Shamir Secret Sharing Schemes: Explanation of Shamir's threshold secret sharing schemes, how they work, and their practical applications for secure secret sharing.
* Multi-Party Computation: Overview of multi-party computation (MPC), which allows multiple parties to compute a function on their private inputs without revealing them, including secure multi-party computation protocols like Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE).
